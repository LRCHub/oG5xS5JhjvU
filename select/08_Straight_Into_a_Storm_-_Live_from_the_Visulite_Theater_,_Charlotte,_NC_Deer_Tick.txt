Is it wrong to think that it ain't no fun
To be anything but second to none?
When I'm second to him every time that I come around
Tell me baby, how long 'til we're gonna get down?
I'm a stranger now in my own house
I'm a brand new man watching her undo her blouse
I see my mama of a princess, though she herself was never a queen
So now I'm heading out West and I'm gonna get this body clean
Throw it out
Make some noise
Whatever that it takes you to destroy
Each and every sign of life but little old me
He's away
He's in jail
Why don't you man the ship before it sets sail?
I said we're heading absolutely, positively straight into a storm
If we go all the way back now, where the story began
Back when I was getting paid and I'm a lucky man
And then I got busy, and I'm messing up all my good things
I said. "I'ma sweep her, oh, sweep her right off her feet."
Now I'm sitting here afraid of my next move
I feel worlds apart from how she thinks I do
Sometimes baby, it feels like maybe I don't have any blood
No heart, no soul, no hands, no feet, no love
Throw it out
Make some noise
Whatever it takes you to destroy
Each and every sign of life but little old me
He's away
He's in jail
Why don't you man the ship before it sets sail?
I said we're heading absolutely, positively straight into a storm
Throw it out
Make some noise
Whatever it takes you to destroy
Each and every sign of life but little old me
He's away
He's in jail
Why don't you man the ship before it sets sail?
I said we're heading absolutely, positively straight into a storm
